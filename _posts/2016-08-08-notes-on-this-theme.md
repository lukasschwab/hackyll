I built this theme on a whim in August 2016 while home visiting family in Portland.

It ain't beautiful, but I wanted a theme which would be fairly content-agnostic to make it easier to throw together various project sites. Achieving this kind of neutrality is fairly difficult. Plaintext is super agnostic, which is why I draft pretty much everything in Sublime, but a straight-up plaintext theme like [this](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) or [this](http://mrcoles.com/demo/markdown-css/). I stumbled across [hack.css](http://hackcss.com/) a few weeks ago while working on the [Hoya Hacks](http://www.hoyahacks.com/) splash page; I think it offers a happy middle ground.

The neutrality of plaintext with the legibility of, uh, formatting.

I hope this is useful! If you already have Jekyll installed (see [Welcome to Jekyll!]({{ site.baseurl }}/welcome)), clone this project github repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lukasschwab/hackyll.git
```

Happy hacking!
